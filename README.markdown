# Rails Blog Base

Base Rails projects used to construct a small to medium site with an integrated blog.

## Purpose
  * All basic functionality included
  * blog
  * authentication
  * basic models/controllers/views for blog)
  * back/front end helper builders for post CRUD (similar to paginate_me, form_for)

## Misc
Might possibly be built into an engine in the future to make it a little more modular and able to be stuck onto an existing site easier.
